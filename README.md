# Password-Generator

Initially built the project using a tutorial (credit in comment at the top of the JS file)

Tweaked the programming in the javascript to:
  - shuffle up the password, using an algorithm. In the original project, the different character types would be produced in a sequence.
  - trim the password down to the correct length. In cases where the length is not evenly divisible by the number of types selected, 
    the resulting password length would be the 'length' plus the remainder.
